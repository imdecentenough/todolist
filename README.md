a simple To-Do list

Using [wxWidgets](https://www.wxwidgets.org/), I was able to create 
a window application that simultaneously handles external files, 
collections of tasks, user prompts, and variable changes to display. 

Features include creating, deleting, and editing tasks off a list, 
customising the display to a different colour, and saving the tasks
and colour presets to an external tasklist.bin file. Loading is not 
yet supported.
